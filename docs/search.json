Dr. Pearce is a cognitive neuroscientist and her research interests center on understanding on the reciprocal association between neurocognitive functioning and pediatric obesity. Dr. Pearce’s current research aims to: 1) characterize cognitive function, neural food-cue responsivity, and eating behaviors in children at high and low familial risk for obesity prior to the development of excess adiposity; 2) identify neurocognitive processes and eating behaviors that confer either risk or resiliency to pediatric obesity; and 3) characterize child eating behaviors through meal microstructure and computational modeling.\nazp271@psu.edu",

His research is focused on methodological development and applications that further our understanding of the complex interdependence that underlies politics and public policy. Methodologically, he focuses on methods for modeling networks, analyzing text, and running experiments on social systems. Primary application areas of interest to Bruce include public policy diffusion and digital communications involving political elites.\nbdesmarais@psu.edu\n\n\n\n\nAna Enriquez\n\n\n\n\nAna Enriquez is the Copyright Officer and Head of the Office of Scholarly Communications and Copyright at the Penn State University Libraries. A copyright lawyer by training, she teaches the university community about copyright and publishing, assists researchers in making their work freely available to the public, and supports the Libraries’ negotiations with publishers. Her research focuses on copyright, teaching copyright, and leveraging library expertise to advance the open access movement.\naee32@psu.edu\n\n\n\n\nFrank Hillary\n\n\n\n\nFrank G. Hillary is a Professor of Psychology and Neurology at Penn State. His research examines the influence of brain injury and disease on functional brain organization over the lifespan. To do so, he incorporates cognitive testing, structural and functional MRI, and network neuroscience approaches (e.g., graph theory) in his work. There is a critical need in the neuroimaging literature for open code and data sharing and convergence on accepted methods to increase scientific reliability. Because of this, over the past 5 years Dr. Hillary’s work has shifted to focus on the reproducibility of neuroimaging work in the study of brain disorders. He is the leader of an international working group, ENIGMA Brain Injury (see: https://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-tbi/), focused on genetics and neuroimaging data sharing and reproducible science.\nfgh3@psu.edu\n\n\n\n\nZülal İşcanoğlu\n\n\n\n\nZülal İşcanoğlu is a postdoctoral researcher with the Development, Risk, and Resilience Lab at Penn State.\nzmi5020@psu.edu\n\n\n\n\nNicole Lazar\n\n\n\n\nNicole Lazar is Professor and Head of the Department of Statistics at Penn State. Her research interests include the foundations of statistical inference and the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. In particular, she has worked on fundamental inferential topics such as model selection, multiple testing problems, and likelihood theory, specifically in the context of modern large-scale data analysis problems. She has done pioneering work on the statistical analysis of cognitive neuroscience data, with a focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Most recently, Lazar has been involved in the application of topological data analysis methods to scientific questions of interest in psychology and climatology. These techniques are at the interface of statistics, mathematics, and computer science, and exemplify her cross-disciplinary approach to research. Lazar is the author of the book The Statistical Analysis of Functional MRI Data published by Springer. Lazar is also Co-PI on an NSF-funded project on fostering open science education for graduate students NSF-1955049 which has led to the formation of the Open Science Alliance.\nnfl5182@psu.edu\n\n\n\n\nValerie Li\n\n\n\n\nValerie Li is a graduate student in Political Science at Penn State University.
